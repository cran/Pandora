This R-Package is a wrapper for the [CKAN
API](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/) of the Pandora data platform.

[Pandora](https://pandora.earth/) seeks a better understanding of the
human story by offering technological solutions to make historical and
archaeological data more accessible and easily findable. It is a
grassroots initiative where research communities from across various
academic disciplines self-curate datasets and self-manage community
membership and roles.
